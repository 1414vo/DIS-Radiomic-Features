# Feature Sensitivity and Model Discrimination in Preclinical Breast Cancer Photoacoustic Imaging
This repository contains Ivo Petrov's apporach to the project **27 Feature Sensitivity and Model Discrimination in Preclinical Breast Cancer Photoacoustic Imaging**. The project aims to reproduce and extend the work done in the paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19084-w">Feasibility and sensitivity study of radiomic features in photoacoustic imaging of patient-derived xenografts</a>. We detail a framework that is used to identify viable radiomic features which are sensitive to the underlying cancer subtype. 2 types of breast cancer are considered, namely **basal** and **luminal B**. We then derive the features' importance in detecting said cancer type.

## Requirements

The user should preferrably have a version of Docker installed in order to ensure correct setup of environments. If that is not possible, the user is recommended to have Conda installed, in order to set up the requirements. If Conda is also not available, make sure that the packages described in `environment.yml` are available and installed.

## Setup

We provide two different set up mechanisms using either Docker or Conda. The former is recommended, as it ensures that the environment used is identical to the one used in the development in the project.
